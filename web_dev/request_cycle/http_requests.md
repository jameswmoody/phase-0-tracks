## What is a cookie? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

> A cookie is a small text file that is stored by a browser on a userâ€™s machine which web servers can then use to
> identify individual users. This is why you are able to click "Keep me logged in" while signing into Facebook and
> whenever you return to http://www.facebook.com, it remembers you and keeps your previous login session going.
