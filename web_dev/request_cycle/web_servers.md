# Web Server Questions

## What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

>The key Linux design philosophy is built around the idea that the user knows what they are doing. Unlike other operating systems that shield what's 'under the hood' to keep an unknowing user from getting themselves into trouble, Linux expects that not only should the user have access to these things but that they will know how to properly interact with whatever they come across.

## In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

> Many hosting services like HostGator, bluehost, and GoDaddy (among a large number of other providers) offer both shared servers where multiple users use > portions of one particular server for hosting and dedicated servers where, as the name implies, a user has their own dedicated server that is maintained by the provider. Many of these same providers also offer a hybrid service that mimics a dedicated server within a shared hosting environment. This is known as a VPS. The benefits include not having to share the same operating system as others on your server, greater privacy, more control, and dedicated resources such as RAM.

## Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

> With most operating systems, it's best practice to have dedicated users set up to run programs while the root user handles admin tasks. This is especially > important while using Linux given it's philosophy. If a program in run on the root user, it could would potentially have the ability to make system changes on > the root and cause all types of havoc.
