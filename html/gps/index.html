<!-- -What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	Semantic tags allow you to follow a bit more of a convention rather than the generic <div> tag. I find <header> and <footer> to be the most useful since the likely have the more direct tag names and together make a nice frame for the rest of the content to be displayed within.

-What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	The the browser displays elements in order from top to bottom in the HTML page.

-What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	While I knew that sublime has code snippets you can use, I've never looked into how to make one myself. It's definately something I plan to do more of since there are many times I find myself reusing the same combo of tags.

-What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	I think the main speedbump my peer and I ran into was creating a new code snippet. Since it was something neither of us had done before, it took a bit of research to understand the syntax and get things working. I think we now both have a much better understanding of how sublime snippets work. -->
