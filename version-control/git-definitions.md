# Git Definitions

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows you to easily keep track of changes in code and rollback changes when nessesary.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a seperate path of a repository with its own commit history. Branches run parallel to each other until merged.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a saved point in a repository's history. It's important to use good commit messages so that it is clear what exact changes where made. 

* What is a merge conflict?

Merge conflict occurs when there are inconsistant changes to the same line or lines of code, such as if two people were to make seperate changes to the same lines of code on the same branch.
